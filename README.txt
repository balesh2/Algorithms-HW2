enumv3.c compiles on the ENGR server using the following gcc command

gcc -lm -o enum enumv3.c

the program can then by run by running "enum".

Different SAMPLE's and tests can be run by commenting out and uncommenting the
SAMPLE variables at the top of the program.


dynamicv6-2.c compiles on the ENGR server using the following gcc command

gcc dynamicv6-2.c

and can be run using the following command

./a.out

Note: Before the file will compile, you must uncomment exactly one SAMPLE worth
of variables, or copy over a TEST from dp2.txt

The zip file contains this .txt file, dp1.txt which contains the TESTs for the
enumeration algorithm, dp2.txt which contains the TESTs for the dynamic
algorithm, dynamicv6-2.c which is the dynamic programming solution, and enumv3.c
which is the brute force solution.
